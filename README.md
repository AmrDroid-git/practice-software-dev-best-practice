# Best Practice Playground

This repository is a **learning and practice space for software engineering best practices**.  
Instead of focusing on a single application, this repo will contain **multiple small projects**, each designed to explore and apply one or more best practices.

---

## Goals

The main purpose of this repo is to **learn by doing**:

- Centralized configuration of **paths** (databases, assets, styles, etc.)
- Managing **styling** (from Python styles to externalized themes)
- Supporting **multiple languages** (English, French, Arabic, etc.)
- Practicing **CRUD operations** in different GUI frameworks
- Structuring code into **modular components** (config, database, UI, logic)
- Applying version control with **Git/GitHub best practices**
- Exploring **different frameworks/libraries** (Tkinter, PyQt, Django, React, etc.)
- Building habits that scale to real-world projects

---

## Current Projects

### 1. Persons Database (Tkinter + SQLite)

- Simple CRUD demo (`id, name, age`)
- Paths configured in `config.py`
- Styling centralized with `ttk.Style`

### 2. Multi-Language UI (coming soon)

- Switching UI labels between English, French, Arabic
- Practice with JSON/YAML translation files

### 3. Styling Demo (coming soon)

- Using externalized style configs
- Comparing approaches (`ttk.Style`, JSON, or theming libraries)

---

## How to Run a Project

Each project is self-contained. To run one, go into its folder and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

For example:

```bash
cd projects/persons-database
python main.py
```

---

## Next Steps

- Add **language support practice** with JSON/labels
- Add **styling practice** with external style configs
- Add a **web app project** (Django/Flask + React)
- Experiment with **unit testing** and **error handling best practices**
- Compare different frameworks for the same problem
